## üí° What Is This?

This is a project I decided to create after seeing all the SaaS websites that offered the ability to you to restream to other platforms. This is a free open-source system that was designed to run in a linux environment with docker and NodeJS. I personally will be setting this up to run in a docker environment such as UNRAID.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

This works by using <b>Docker</b> containers that use <b>RTMPS</b> and <b>STUNNEL</b> to send a stream to different platforms and can be managed via a simple web interface. You can run NGINX with RTMP module to push your stream to the other docker containers or you can run this entire system in a container and just mount the main docker socket to this container.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Project Information
I am very new to fullstack development and this was pretty much my first experience with Svelte and Express. If you have suggestions open a üì© (issue) and ‚≠ê (star) the project if you think I did a good job!
